- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @griffim

I hold a B.S. in Chemistry from UC Santa Cruz, and am currently teaching myself C++ and Python.

I am skilled in the technical side of science with an ability to troubleshoot with success.

At UCSC, I focussed on organic chemistry and its relation to biochemistry in vitro and in vivo.
AT Bristol Myers Squibb, I worked on the automation instruments to product dose response curve assays down to nanoliter and picomolar scale.
